                A blue bird fluttering in the heavens. She sings a love song for the souls of the living.

                Enna is a blunt and honest girl who doesn't mince words and rarely hesitates to speak her mind, no matter the subject. She also has a mischievous streak and enjoys intentionally annoying people with pranks, teasing, and incessant insults, giving her a reputation as the resident "gremlin" of Ethyria (although she usually shares this position with her best friend, Millie Parfait). She has a short temper and is notable for her very frequent swearing, especially when provoked - upon which she has a tendency to practically explode into rage and a continuous string of expletives.

                As much as she frequently roasts her peers and chat without remorse, Enna is also somewhat pessimistic and frequently delves into varying degrees of self-deprecation, and is known to casually joke about unfortunate happenings in her life. However, her honesty goes both ways, as she often dispenses wisdom and encouragement straight from the heart and frequently expresses her gratitude towards her fans, fellow Livers, and other figures in her life.

                She frequently claims to have a 32 / 10 personality. While the significance of the specific number 32 / 10 remains unknown, others (namely her chat and fellow Nijisanji Virtual Youtuber Kyo Kaneko) have agreed she has, at least, an over 10 / 10 personality.
